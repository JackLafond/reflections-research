In this paper the researchers conducted a longitudinal study to test the impacts of different uncertainty visualizations during the 2022 midterm elections. The visualizations they used inlcuded a single quantile dotplot, a dual quantile dotplot, dual histogram intervals, and a plinko quantile dotplot. Their goal was to understand how different visualization techniques for displaying elections impact a users emotions, trust, and activity in elections. Previous research has been done on which visualization best model uncertainty, which guided the researchers in which models to use. Preliminary studies inlcuded survey people who have visited election forecast websites in previous elections like FiveThirtyEight. They found that for a large majority of election forecasts participants felt negative emotions from them. For their data they used day to day results from FiveThirtyEight, and used similar forecasting techniques as presidential elections. They also assumed that no third party would pose a major challenge. FOr the single quantile dotplot it is similar to a beeswarm plot and density distribution where one dot represents one election outcome, and 100 dots are plotted leading to a "out of 100 elections _ wins _ amount of times". The dual quantile plot shows 2 single quantiles but for each party, and their individual distributions can be compared to see who has the better chance. The dual histogram intervals again show probabilities for both parties, but encode the probabilities using varying hues on connected rectangles to show the probability distribution. Finally the plinko quantile is an animated plot designed to try to show the process of forecasting. The resulting plot is similar to the single quantile dot plot. They found that for both parties, when a supported candidate is predicted to win, negtive emotions are decreased, positive emotions are increased, and trust is increased, although these results were less significant amoong republican candidates. Comparing the visualizations, they found that the 2-interval histograms has the largest effects, increasing negative emotions the most when a republican was predicted to win. The single quantile plot made people feel the most surprised when a democrat was predicted to win, and least surprised when a republican was predicted to win. Using these plots there were also able to understand the partisan effects of each party on election emotions, trust, and activity. They admit that a limitation is that most elections went the way of the predictions which having a wrong prediction is an important scenario for evaluating emotions, trust and activity.
