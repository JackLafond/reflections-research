In sports an important skill is anticipating what the opponent is going to do. A lot of times this takes much data collection, research, and analysis to try to predict your opponents move. In this paper, the researchers attempt to create a complete solution for table tennis players that would allow them to accurately analyze matches and therefore improve their anticiaption skills. The researchers consulted domain experts in order to understand what shape the data will take as well as what the functional needs of this solution are. They start of by defining an anticipation behavior, which is a set of strokes within a rally that a player can use to predict the next move of their opponent. They also define specific about the data they are dealing with. For exmaple one stroke has 4 attributes; technique, position, placement, and launch. They used live videos and existing data collection frameworks in order to collect all of their data. They also define two important calculations to assess the effectiveness of a player's anticipation. They consider how fast a player anticipates the next stroke (like was it well before the reaction phase which would be after the opponent hits), and they also consider how accurate the anticiaption was (like did they get to the right spot ahead of time or did they have to make a large adjustement in the reaction phase). They then introduce their solution which is a user interface that allows a user to view different matches. For each match they plot a scatter plot of aniticipation behaviors that shows the efficiency and accuracy of different behaviors. Selecting a group of behaviors allows a user to view them in more detail in the anticipation view. In this view there is information about the players distance over time, their trajectory, and information about the stroke. I partocularly like the way they displayed the infomation in coordinated plots that simplified the views. In an anticipation plot, there is a distance to final position over time line chart that shows how close a player is to their final position before they hit the ball. This simple chart can show how effectively a player anticipated a stroke with just one line. If the distance rapidly changes after a hit, then the player guessed incorrectly. If the ditance doesn't change much until after the hit, than they were unable to anticipate anything. I also like that they inlcuded player trajectory to contextualize the movement. Organizing the other stroke attributes into small plots on the right hand side that add more context in a simple way was also a nice touch. When multiple anticipations are selected, they views are aggregated and can display the stroke attributes through hues like a heat map, which is an effecient way of mapping the aggregated data.
